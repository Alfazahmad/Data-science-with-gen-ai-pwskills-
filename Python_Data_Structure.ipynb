        "Conceptual Questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important? Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently. They are important because they allow efficient access, modification, and storage of data, and are the foundation for algorithms and software design.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable data types can be changed after their creation. Example: Lists ([1, 2, 3]).\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable data types cannot be changed after their creation. Example: Strings (\"hello\"), Tuples ((1, 2, 3)).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, while tuples are immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists use square brackets [], and tuples use parentheses ().\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples are generally faster than lists for iteration due to their immutability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data. Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and the value can be any data type. They are unordered collections.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python? Sets are used when uniqueness of elements is important and when the order of elements does not matter. Sets automatically remove duplicates and provide faster membership testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list? A string is an immutable sequence of characters, while a list is a mutable collection of elements. Strings can only store characters, while lists can store any type of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python? Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their values cannot be modified. This ensures that the data remains unchanged, providing integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python? A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python? Yes, lists can contain elements of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, and other lists).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python. Strings are immutable to ensure consistency and performance. Since strings are frequently used in many operations, immutability avoids issues like accidental changes, leading to better memory management and optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks? Dictionaries offer faster lookups and key-based access to values, whereas lists are slower for such operations since they require index-based access.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list. Tuples are preferable when you need to store a collection of values that should remain constant, like coordinates (x, y) or fixed configurations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python? Sets automatically remove duplicate values and only store unique elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the \"in\" keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In lists, \"in\" checks if an element is present.\n",
        "\n",
        "In dictionaries, \"in\" checks if a key is present.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not. No, tuples are immutable. Their elements cannot be modified after they are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case? A nested dictionary is a dictionary where values are themselves dictionaries. Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "nested_dict = {'person': {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}}\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary. Accessing an element in a dictionary by key is O(1) on average.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries? Lists are preferred when you need to maintain an ordered collection of elements and may need to perform operations like sorting or iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval? Dictionaries do not guarantee any specific order of elements. However, the key-value access remains efficient, and order is only relevant in contexts like iteration in Python 3.7+.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In lists, data is retrieved using index positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In dictionaries, data is retrieved using keys."
